Furniture photoshoots are often time-consuming, expensive, and inflexible. For brands working on tight schedules and budgets — especially during product launches or seasonal campaigns — the traditional photoshoot process can be a serious bottleneck.

At Debutiques, we help furniture brands completely rethink the way they produce product visuals by replacing or supporting photography with high-end CGI and 3D rendering.

## Why Traditional Photoshoots Get Expensive Fast

**Logistics:** Booking studios, transporting products, styling sets — all of this adds up quickly.

**Revisions:** Need to change a color or background after the shoot? You'll likely have to reshoot the entire scene.

**Time pressure:** Shoots often need to be locked in weeks in advance. Not ideal when you're launching multiple new products.

## A Better Approach: Photorealistic 3D Renders

We create realistic 3D product images and environments — without the need for a physical shoot. These are tailored to your brand, easy to revise, and ready in days, not weeks.

You can use CGI to:

- Show your furniture in different colors or finishes
- Place your product in custom-designed interiors  
- Create consistent lighting and styling across your whole collection
- Generate images for your website, social, catalog, or press with full control

## What Types of Visuals We Offer

**Studio Renders:** Simple white or colored background for e-commerce.

**Interior Renders:** Custom-designed spaces styled to match your brand.

**360° Spinning Animations:** Ideal for online product pages.

**Assembly Animations:** Show how your product works or comes together.

**Social Clips:** Short, minimal animations designed for campaigns.

## Cut Costs, Gain Control

With 3D rendering, there's no need to ship products or book a studio. You save money, but also gain flexibility: update colors, change angles, or reuse environments any time you need.

If you're a furniture brand looking to cut costs without compromising on quality — this is the smartest, most flexible approach.
