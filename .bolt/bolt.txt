We started by discussing the design guidelines for your web pages, focusing on using JSX, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. We then addressed an issue with a missing "privacy policy" link in the footer's navigation section. Following that, you provided new content for the privacy policy, which I then formatted for improved readability. Most recently, I deployed your application to Netlify, and it is now live at https://debutiques.com.
