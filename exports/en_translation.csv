"faq.title","FAQ – Debutiques | CGI Studio & 3D Rendering"
"faq.items.renderingProcess.question","How does the 3D rendering process work?"
"faq.items.renderingProcess.answer","The 3D rendering process involves several key steps. Initially, we start by understanding your product and goals through an on-site meeting or a virtual video call. Once your project's objectives are clearly defined, we create a detailed 3D model of the object or scene. Next, we apply textures, materials, and realistic detailing to the model. We then add carefully configured lighting to generate realistic shadows and reflections. Finally, we perform the rendering phase, transforming your 3D model into a photorealistic 2D image or animation. If you have feedback, we refine the visuals until you're completely satisfied."
"faq.items.cgiFurniture.question","What is CGI furniture?"
"faq.items.cgiFurniture.answer","CGI stands for ""Computer Generated Imagery."" CGI furniture refers to furniture models created entirely digitally on a computer. These virtual furniture pieces can be showcased in digital environments and used effectively in visual marketing by furniture, home decor, and lifestyle brands."
"faq.items.3dVisualization.question","What exactly is 3D visualization?"
"faq.items.3dVisualization.answer","3D visualization is a digital representation of physical objects or scenes displayed in three-dimensional form as images or animations. At Debutiques, our dedicated 3D visualization team specializes in producing high-end visual content specifically tailored for the furniture, home, and lifestyle industries."
"faq.items.turnaroundTime.question","How long does it take to produce a 3D rendering at Debutiques?"
"faq.items.turnaroundTime.answer","The turnaround time for 3D renderings depends greatly on several factors, including the complexity of the model, desired visual quality, and project scope. A straightforward 3D visualization can typically be completed within a few hours, while more complex animations might take several days or even weeks."
"faq.items.businessBenefits.question","How can product visualization benefit my business?"
"faq.items.businessBenefits.answer","Product visualization allows you to showcase your products in ways difficult or impossible with traditional photography. It enables detailed views from every possible angle, experimenting with lighting setups, and testing different colors and textures. Moreover, 3D visualization can clearly illustrate a product's functionality, demonstrate complicated concepts, and significantly reduce expenses when presenting multiple product variations."
"faq.items.visualizationTypes.question","What types of 3D visualizations does Debutiques offer?"
"faq.items.visualizationTypes.answer","Debutiques offers a comprehensive range of 3D visualization services, including:

• Standalone product renderings (with or without background)
• Interior and exterior environment visualizations
• Contextual product presentations within digitally created settings
• 3D animations and video renderings
• Augmented Reality (AR) visualizations, allowing virtual products to be displayed seamlessly in real-world environments

Looking for inspiration? Feel free to explore our featured CGI projects to see what's possible!"
"faq.items.pricing.question","How much does a CGI visualization typically cost?"
"faq.items.pricing.answer","Pricing for 3D visualization services varies based on complexity and type of deliverable. Simple static visualizations can start from a few hundred dollars, whereas comprehensive animations and AR visualizations may cost several thousand dollars. To get an accurate and personalized quote, please reach out directly—consultations and quotes are always free and come with no obligation."
"faq.items.cgiStudio.question","What exactly is a CGI studio?"
"faq.items.cgiStudio.answer","A CGI or 3D studio is a specialized agency focused on creating digital visualizations and animations for businesses. These studios offer flexibility compared to hiring in-house 3D artists, as you can commission specific projects whenever needed without the overhead and long-term commitment of full-time employees."
